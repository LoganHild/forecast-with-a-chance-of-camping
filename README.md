# Forecast With A Chance Of Camping
Our web application is aimed for easy process of locating recreational outdoor facilities with a specific zip code. At the same time, it pulls the current 7-day forecast. It allows users to be aware of the weather conditions and plan their outdoor activities accordingly.

Forecast with a Chance of Camping saves time and energy for what really matters. 

## Description 
This is a group project of team E.L.L.A. It helps users that are looking for campsites/activities in the area to find suitable option for outdoor activity with regards to weather for that day. This application uses third-party APIs, runs in the browser, and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS.

The data is stored in LocalStorage. We use the OpenWeather and RIDB APIs to retrieve weather and recreation data. 

## User Story
AS an avid camper and an outdoors person
I WANT to locate campgrounds within a specific zip code and the weather forecast for the current 7 days
SO THAT I can be adequately prepared for the weather during my trip
GIVEN a campsite dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I input a zip code and choose a date
THEN I am presented with a list of available campsites in the area and the current weather conditions for that location 
WHEN I view the available campsites 
THEN I am presented with a photo of that campground, a description, and the link that brings me to the campsite's website
WHEN I input a zip code that returns no campsites
THEN I am presented with a notification telling me to go back to the homepage
